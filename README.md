# Analog Node Setup Script

This repository contains a script to easily set up an Analog node. The script checks for and installs necessary dependencies like Docker and websocat if they are not already installed. If these dependencies are already present, the script will skip their installation and proceed directly to setting up the Analog node.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have `git` installed. This is necessary to clone the repository.

### Install Git

If `git` is not already installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install git
